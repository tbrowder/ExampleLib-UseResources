=head1 NAME

B<ExampleLib::UseResources> - Provides routines to access $?DISTRIBUTION rsources for installed module distributions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
# Copy and rename its module and test file into your
# module's repo. Then use its routines to query and
# download your installed module's repository contents.
$ copy-resources-module file=Utils  mod=Module::Utils
# OUTPUT

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides module authors with a Rakumod module file to
copy and paste into their own module distribution repo that will
enable them to use the special variable, C<$?DISTRIBUTION>, to access
files included in an installed module distribution.

=head2 Use the module in your code

To use it in your module repo 'MyModule', copy this module's
'/lib/ExampleLib/UseResources.rakumod' file to a unique module in your
repo's 'lib' directory, rename it as appropriate, and update its
inside name accordingly.  Note there is a special binary executable
installed with this module to do that for you:

=begin code
copy-resources-module file=<desired module file name> mod=<desired module name>
=end code

The process also creates a test file for that installation. Note the
files are created in the current directory, and you will have to put
them in their proper place manually.

=head2 Module details

For example, say your module's file structure includes the following files:

=begin code
resources/file1         # <= exists, listed in 'META6.json'
resources/file2         # <= exists, listed in 'META6.json'
resources/sdir/file3    # <= exists, listed in 'META6.json'
../lib/MyModule.rakumod # <= exists, listed in 'META6.json'
../t/01-basic.rakutest  # <= exists, NOT listed in 'META6.json'
resources/file4         # <= NONE EXISTENT, BUT listed in 'META6.json'
=end code

In general, any I<existing> file in the distribution's repository
directory is accessible via use of this module I<if and only if> its
path, relative to the 'resources' directory is listed in the
I<resources> section of the 'META6.json'. Note it does I<not> have to
be listed in the 'resources' directory as long as its relative path is correctly
listed in 'META6.json'.

Following are examples illustrating those rules:

=begin item
File 'resources/file4'

ERROR: The file I<cannot> be accessed because it does not exist, even
though it is listed in the C<META6.json> file.

=end item

=begin item
File 't/01-basic.rakutest'

ERROR: The file I<cannot> be accessed because it is I<not> listed in
the C<META6.json> file.

=end item

=begin item
File '../lib/MyModule.rakumod'

ODDITY: The file's contents are available because its relatiive
path is correctly listed in the 'META6.json' file.

=end item

For the moment, authors must list the desired resources twice: once in
the C<META6.json> file and once in the source code's C<resources>
directory.

=head2 Limitation relief

Eventally, C<App::Mi6>'s C<mi6> binary program's C<build> command will
ensure the C<META6.json>'s C<resources> list is the exact duplicate of
the source C<resources> directory so the author will not have to
maintain two lists. (See issue #176 at
L<https://github.com/skaji/mi6>.)
